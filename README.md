_Komodo Periphery agent for monitoring Home Assistant OS system metrics._

## About

This add-on runs the Komodo Periphery agent on your Home Assistant OS installation, allowing you to monitor system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage) and manage Docker containers through a centralized Komodo Core server.

Komodo is a lightweight, Rust-based system for building and deploying software across multiple servers. The Periphery agent connects to your Komodo Core server and reports system health metrics while providing remote management capabilities.

## Installation

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Supervisor** â†’ **Add-on Store**.
2. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/your-username/komodo-periphery-addon`
3. Find the "Komodo Periphery" add-on and click it.
4. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

1. Set the required configuration options (see Configuration section below).
2. Start the add-on.
3. Check the add-on log output to verify successful connection to your Komodo Core server.

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```yaml
komodo_address: "https://your-komodo-server.com"
komodo_api_key: "your-api-key"
komodo_api_secret: "your-api-secret"
log_level: "info"
stats_polling_rate: "5-sec"
container_stats_polling_rate: "1-min"
ssl_enabled: true
monitor_homeassistant: true
```

### Option: `komodo_address` (required)

The full URL of your Komodo Core server (e.g., `https://komodo.example.com`).

### Option: `komodo_api_key` (required)

Your Komodo API key for authentication.

### Option: `komodo_api_secret` (required)

Your Komodo API secret for authentication.

### Option: `log_level`

Controls the verbosity of log output. Valid values: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

### Option: `stats_polling_rate`

How often to poll the system for stats like CPU and memory usage. 
Valid values: `1-sec`, `5-sec`, `10-sec`, `30-sec`, `1-min`, etc.

### Option: `container_stats_polling_rate`

How often to poll for Docker container statistics.
Valid values: `1-sec`, `5-sec`, `10-sec`, `30-sec`, `1-min`, etc.

### Option: `ssl_enabled`

Enable HTTPS for the Periphery API. Self-signed certificates will be generated if not provided.

### Option: `monitor_homeassistant`

Enable monitoring of Home Assistant service status on the host system.

### Option: `allowed_ips` (optional)

List of IP addresses allowed to access the Periphery API. Empty list allows all IPs.

```yaml
allowed_ips:
  - "192.168.1.100"
  - "10.0.0.50"
```

### Option: `passkeys` (optional)

List of passkeys required to access the Periphery API.

```yaml
passkeys:
  - "your-secure-passkey"
```

## Security

This add-on requires several elevated privileges to monitor system metrics and manage Docker containers:

- **Docker API access**: Required to monitor and manage containers
- **Host network monitoring**: Required to gather system statistics
- **SYS_ADMIN capability**: Required for certain system monitoring operations

The add-on runs as a non-root user (`komodo`) for security, but needs Docker group access for container management.

**Important Security Notes:**
- Use strong, unique API keys and secrets
- Consider using IP allowlists in production environments
- Enable SSL/TLS for encrypted communication
- Regularly update the add-on to receive security patches
